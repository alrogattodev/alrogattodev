Backend Developer | Node.js, Express, and API Architect

With over 20 years in software, Iâ€™m a backend developer focused on building reliable, high-performance systems. My expertise spans Node.js, Express, API design, and database optimization. I love crafting backend solutions that are robust, scalable, and efficient.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:

Core: Node.js, Express, API Design (RESTful and GraphQL)
Databases: MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, SQL, Redis
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD

ðŸ’¡ What I Bring:
Backend architecture thatâ€™s as maintainable as it is powerful. Whether itâ€™s optimizing APIs, scaling microservices, or integrating complex systems, Iâ€™m all about backend or infra jobs.
